# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge repository! This repository serves as a tracking tool for my progress as I embark on a journey to learn programming and improve my skills. The challenge involves coding for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days.

## Motivation
I've decided to take up this challenge to develop discipline, build a strong coding foundation, and enhance my problem-solving skills. This challenge will help me explore different programming concepts and technologies, and eventually, become a proficient developer.

## Programming Language
During this challenge, I will primarily be focusing on learning and practicing Kotlin. Kotlin is a modern, expressive, and powerful language that is widely used for Android app development and other applications. By mastering Kotlin, I aim to develop robust and efficient software solutions.
